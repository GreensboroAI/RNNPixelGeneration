# RNNPixelGeneration
Use RNN to create or fill in an image

# Goal
To create a RNN similar to that of the one outlined in the Deepmind paper. It is fascinating to think of a computer generating images based on what it has learned, almost like drawing images. If this can be extrapolated to generating images ahead say 60 steps then it could also be used to create animations/video.

# Work
I am just in the beginning of this process so I am search for papers and articles/tutorials on the subject.
